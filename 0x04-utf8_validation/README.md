# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

This project involves validating whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The data set can contain multiple characters, and each integer in the list represents 1 byte of data. The goal is to write a function that checks if the provided data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
